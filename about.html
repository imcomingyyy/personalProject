            <p>Hello there</p>
            
            <p>I am just a college student who is currently enrolled in the computer science degree, begin to develop how to code quickly, accuarately and efficient. I aspire to be a professional web developer.
            </p>
            <p>I plan to develop more features on this Web III project. E.g have a user account, able to login in and login save and retrieve file from the server. Unfortunately, this semester is hit terribly on Covid19. I lose a lot of time and priorities for this
                project since my family health is my top priority. Plus,
                 alternative school learning also affect both student and teachers
                  physically and mentally. I hope everyone stays safe during the pandemic.
                   Be a useful site is my ultimate goal,
                enjoy the site. Thank you for visiting this site.
