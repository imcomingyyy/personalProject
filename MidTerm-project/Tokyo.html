    <h1>Tokyo</h1>
    <p>If Kyoto is the heart of traditional Japan, Tokyo is its ultramodern counterpart.
        It’s here you’ll find the skyscrapers, noisy arcades,
        busy pedestrian crossings, crazy youth fashions, and many many incredibly delicious restaurants.
        If all you do in Tokyo is eat, you’ll have an amazing time—even as vegetarians we ate so well.
        Tokyo is also home to some of the weirdest activities we’ve ever done. From themed cafes
        (cats, owls, maids, robots, goats—you name it, Tokyo has it) to sensory-overload shows and arcades to cos-play
        go-karting.
        there is so much to do that I won’t want to skip it.
